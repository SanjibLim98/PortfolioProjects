Excel Project Documentation:

1. Created new tabs - Working Sheet, Pivot Tables, Dashboard
2. Selected the whole table and removed duplicates - removed 26 duplicates from the data.
3. The column 'Maritial Status' and 'Gender' both uses 'M' as their values, meaning either 'Married' or 'Male' respectively.
   To avoid any confusion, the 'Find and Replace' tool (CTRL + H) was used to update the Marrial Status and Gender values.
4. The Age values are not condensed into a range. It would be easier to visualise tables/dashboards if they were categorised
   within an age bracket (e.g. Adolescent, Middle-aged, Old). Nested '=IF()' formula was used to create If/Else statements.

5. Created a pivot table to determine whether the average income between male and female had any effect on purchasing a bike. A bar chart was 
   created from the pivot table to visualise the data. It was clear that the higher average income were more likely to purchase a bike. 

6. Another pivot table was created to see if the distance that customer travelled for work influenced them to buy a bike. A line chart was created
   which indicated that customers who commuted further were less likely to purchase a bike. 

7. Another pivot table was created to inspect whether an age range were more particularly buying more bike. From the line chart, it was clear
   that the middle aged group were significantly purchasing more bikes than the other two age groups. 

8. Lastly, the dashboard was created. All of the charts created in the pivot table was transferred into this page. The grids were removed 
   for visual purposes. The 'PivotChart Analyse Slicer' feature was used to analyse if different variables influenced customers to purchase a bike, 
   including maritial status, region, and education. All of the slicers were connected to all of the tables with 'Report Connections'.
   This helps narrow the certain demographic even futher and filter through all of them.
