1. Filled in the empty column spaces (column F-M). 
   - Customer name, Email and Country is filled using XLOOKUP.

   - Index() function is used with Match() to populate Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, and Unit Price columns.
     // learned how to use Absolute, Relative and Mixed references in a formula. 

   - Sales field was calculated by simply multiplying the Unit Price with the Quantity Sold

2. The Coffee Type and Roast Type fields are only using abbreviation. Two new columns were created and filled with the full names
    by using IF/ELSE function.
   

3. Number Formatting Cells (CTRL + 1)

   - Changed the date format, using letter abbreviation instead of just numbers to avoid confusion 
     between Europian/American date format. Custom: dd/mmm/yyyy
   - Added metric units for the Size; Custom: 0.0"kg"
   - Added currency units for Unit Price and Sales 
   - Selected entire table and check/remove duplicates. 

4. Converted range into table (CTRL + T)
   -  Excel tables automatically expand or contract to accommodate changes to the data. When you add 
      new data to the table or modify existing data, the table range adjusts automatically.
   -  Excel pivot tables have a built-in feature to automatically refresh when changes are detected in the source 
      data. This means that when you make changes to the table data, such as adding, removing, or modifying records, the pivot table 
      will refresh itself to reflect these changes.

5. Pivot Table was created (ALT + N+V+T)
   - Pivot table was created to look at the sum of sales of the different coffee types over the past years. 
   - A line chart with a time line was produced from this table. Also various slicers (size, roast type, loyalty card) 
     to inspect how different variables affected the price.

6. Duplicated the Pivot table twice in two more work sheets. One for Sales by Country and other for Top 5 customers.
   - A simple bar chart was created to visualise the data.

7. Lastly, a Dashboard was created with all of the line and bar charts. Report connections were applied to all of the timeline and slicers
   so it displayed changes to all of the graphs.
